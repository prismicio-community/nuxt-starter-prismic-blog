## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To start a new project using this starter, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npx prismic-cli@latest theme \
  --theme-url https://github.com/prismicio-community/nuxt-starter-prismic-blog \
  --conf sm.json
```

This command will do the following:

1. Ask you to log in to Prismic or [create an account](https://prismic.io/dashboard/signup).
2. Create a new Prismic content repository.
3. Start a new Nuxt project using this starter.

To learn more about working with Prismic, [**see the Prismic docs**](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/nextjs).

## Using and customizing your project

To get started after creating your new project, go to [prismic.io/dashboard](https://prismic.io/dashboard), click on the repository for this website, and start editing.

### Create a page

To create a page, click on the green pencil icon, then selectÂ **Page**.

Your new page will be accessible by its URL, but it won't appear on the website automatically. To let users discover it, add it to the navigation.

### Update the navigation

To add a page to your navigation menu, go to the document list and open the **Navigation** document. In the **Links** group, click **Add a new element in Links**. Select the page to add and fill in a label.

### Preview documents

In your repository, go to _Settings > Previews_. Under _Create a New Preview_, fill in the three fields:

- a name (like **Development** or **Production**)
- the domain where your app is running (like <http://localhost:3000> or <https://www.yoursite.com>)
- `/api/preview` for the Link Resolver

Now, go to a draft document and click the eye icon in the top-right corner.

To learn more about how to configure previews, read [Preview Drafts in Nuxt](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/nuxt-preview-drafts) in the Prismic documentation.

### Customize this website

This website is preconfigured with Prismic. Functionality is provided by the `@nuxtjs/prismic` package, which makes Prismic utilities available throughout the app. Take a look at the code to see how it's used.

### Edit the code

There are two steps to rendering content from Prismic in your Nuxt project:

1. Fetch content from the Prismic API
2. Template the content

Here are some of the files in your project that you can edit:

- `nuxt.config.js` - The `prismic` property includes configurations for `@nuxtjs/prismic`.
- `pages/index.vue` - This is the app homepage. It queries and renders a page document with the UID (unique identifier) "home" from the Prismic API.
- `pages/[uid].vue` - This is the page component, which queries and renders a page document from your Prismic repository based on the UID.
- `netlify/functions/contact.js`Â - This is the Netlify function for your contact form. To use the contact form, send a POST request to a back end from this endpoint.
- `netlify/functions/sign-up.js`Â - This is the Netlify function for your newsletter form. To allow signups, send a POST request to a newsletter service like Mailchimp.
- `slices/\*/index.vue` - Each Slice in your project has an index.js file that renders the Slice component. Edit this file to customize your Slices.

These are important files that you should leave as-is:

- `pages/slice-simulator.vue` - Do not edit or delete this file. This file simulates your Slice components in development.
- `slices/` - This directory contains Slice components, which are generated programmatically by Slice Machine. To customize a Slice template, you can edit the Slice's `index.js` file. To add Slices, delete Slices, or edit Slice models, use Slice Machine (more info below).

Learn more about how to edit your components with [Fetch Data in Nuxt](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/nuxt-fetch-data) and [Template Content in Nuxt](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/nuxt-template-content).

Styling in this project is implemented with Tailwind CSS. See the [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for more info.

### Deploy to the web

To put your project online, see [Deploy your Nuxt App](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/nuxt-deploy).

### Edit content models with Slice Machine

This project includes an application called Slice Machine, which generates models for your Custom Types and Slices. Slice Machine stores the models locally in your codebase, so you can save and version them. It also syncs your models to Prismic. To learn how to use Slice Machine, read [Model Content in Nuxt](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/nuxt-model-content).

If you change or add to your Custom Types, you'll need to update your route handling to match. To learn how to do that, read [Define Paths in Nuxt](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/nuxt-define-routes).
